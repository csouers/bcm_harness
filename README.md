# bodyharness (Work in Progress)

## Get access to your body control module's CAN bus (or multiple busses), K-Line, and L-Line without damaging or back-probing the vehicle's electrical wiring.

This hardware, together with the necessary software, makes it possible to control turn signals, lights, and more. This project is intended to be 100% reversible in minutes. No cutting any wires!

We're currently using a comma.ai panda (white or grey) for the brains. Black panda can be supported with additional effort (no plans for this at the moment). The supported pandas have 3 CAN busses, K-Line, L-Line, and a single GMLAN (operates in place of one of the panda's CAN bus connections).
