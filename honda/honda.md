## BCM Types
### Type 1
Type 1 is a name given by this project, not by Honda engineers. Type 1 BCMs use a module developed by Continental. This particular module uses 6-8 connectors, one of which is a 36 pin connector and is colored Light Blue. The 10g Civic and 5g CRV happen to both use this style of BCM. Further research will reveal if other vehicles use a similar connector for the B-CAN and F-CAN-A (OBD2) connection.

### Type 2
Type 2 vehicles use 2x high pin count connectors for the interconnect with the car's wiring harness. This style of connector is likely to be unsupported for an intercept-style of connection. Lots of connections that are important in a crash (SRS detection wire/pin) and more expensive to manufacture and test as well. I have yet to find a source for the connector set for this style.

### 6 Pin Option Connector
Many Honda vehicles feature an option connector for things like after manufacture fog lights, interior footwell lighting, etc. This connector, as of the 10g Civic, features a B-CAN connection. This is the current way forward for a majority of vehicles. Soon, research will conclude whether this connector is more ubiquitous than first thought. This connector set is presently difficult to obtain in an economical way in the US. Purchase tra
